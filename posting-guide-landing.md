# How to post?
In order for you to post, you need the "Contributor" role which is granted as soon as you are verfied by a Moderator or Admin. If you dont know you current status, check out the Menu bar at the left, if you see "Wiki Guides", then you are a Contributor!

Let's start by creating a page, make sure you know what you want to create. If you want e.g. create a guide for texturing, then you have to link it accordingly.

## Step 1

1. Create a new page by selecting the "New Page" Icon at your **top** menu bar.
2. For page location, select the page which fit's the guide *(example: for texturing I would choose Texturing Landing page*. Click that and the URL will refresh at the bottom of the new window. Now you enter a dash ("/") and choose a short name for your new page.
3. Make sure you checked out the "Before you click" section at this step!
4. Click "Select"

Now you created a new page which you can edit in the next steps.

### Before you click!
Make sure you checked the following:

- You selected the correct page, this can also mean that the path would be longer:
(examples: /texture-landing/maya/*your name*), if there are categories already, you can select the fitting folder on the left side of the window aswell!
- make sure the choosen name is not yet used, otherways you will enter the edit mode of that page
- if you are unsure what to do, don't hesitate to ask before you click, we are always here to help and this is also easy to understand once you've done it!

## Step 2
Selecting the right Editor!
Since we are using Github, we need all pages in **Markdown**, don't use the Visual editor or any other option.

Once you selected "markdown", the editor will open including a new settings window. This window contains of:
- The title
- The page description
- The path (this can be changed so even if you linked something wrong, nothing is cursed, mostly we will tell you and you have to fix it ^^)
- Tags (by clicking in the Tags field, you can select tags which were already created, make sure you use them aswell, this does not mean, that you aren't allowed to create new tags!)

At the top you can also see tabs: **Scheduling, Scripts, Styles**, you can schedule a page if you dont want to release it yet, however, dont forget about it. You can also publish unfinished guides, thats not an issue, as long as you keep working on it.

## Step 3
Edit the page. Its pretty simple, you can use any Markdown feature thats available. You might need to get used to it, but its not that bad once you get the hang of it. All you need to know here is, that **Headers** determin an anker point. 

# Edit existing pages
You are allowed to edit existing guides and pages, which does not mean, that you can write whatever you want. You as contributor can't see the page history, the Mods can and will check. Abusing this feature will lead into an exclusion of the Runeforge Wiki permanently.
