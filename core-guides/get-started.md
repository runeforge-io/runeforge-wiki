## Editing Software
Editing software is as the name suggests here to modify said gamefiles. Therefore you need 2D, 3D and maybe Coding software. Behind each Button, you see what files you can edit with those tools from the selected category, skip those which you currently don't need.

*Sidenote: There are plenty more tools, but since this can get overwhelming we skip those for now, we recommend using the tools which suit your current goals and those required in their specific guides.*
