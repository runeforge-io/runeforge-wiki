# Maya Errorlist

> Disclaimer: This list is not exhaustive. Maya is a sophisticated tool, and the expected outcomes may vary based on the plugins and versions in use. Additionally, we are unable to provide a comprehensive list of all potential errors that may arise during your experience with Maya. Instead, we will focus on common errors specifically encountered when modding League of Legends models.

# Common Errors

## Unrecognized file type

![unknownfile.png](/user-pictures/bud/unknownfile.png)
This error occurs when you try to import a file that maya can't read. In the case of League Skn you most likely didn't install/enable the plugin properly.

- **Fix**
Import a file format maya can read. If you're trying to import .skn you will need to install the [LoLmaya plugin](https://wiki.runeforge.dev/core-guides/tools/maya#install-lol-maya) first.
