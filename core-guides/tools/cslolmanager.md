In order to install CS-LoL, you simply have to execute the file and choose the filepath. Once finished, open CS-LoL and choose the "game"-folder for League of Legends. 
The standard installation path would be: 
`C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Game`
Now press select and you're done!

# Install a Mod
Once you have the CS-LoL-Manager set up, downloading mods is rather straightforward from then on. Simply take the .zip or [.fantome](/specific-guide/filetypes#fantome) file that you downloaded on our site for the relevant skin, and drag and drop it into the program.

![running_skins.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/running_skins.webp)
As you add the skin into the program, simply click the box to mark it as selected, and click run on the top right corner for it to run.

This is it! Click stop if you don’t want to load the skins anymore, or reselect and add new skins to enjoy them all to your fullest. 

# Update CS-LoL Manager

Updating CSLoL-Manager is quite simple.
On the main folder you have been using the program in, you delete everything except for the folders and the “Config” file.

![update_cslol.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/update_cslol.webp)

Whereafter what you do, is run the installer of the updated CSLoL-Manager and extract it in the same main folder, where a popup shows up:

![update_cslol_2.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/update_cslol_2.webp)

Here you just click “Auto Rename” and it will extract the files. 

 

And that’s all! Now CSLoL is updated! 
# Create a mod package
## Step 1 Folder structure

Start by renaming all folders of your mod the same way as its listed in the original data.

</video>

![folder_structure.png](/user-pictures/vector/general-guides/general/folder_structure.png =25%x)
As you can see in the video and the picture above, this is the exact same folder structure as her .wad file. You also need to keep the files in place as in the original.

## Step 2 CS-Lol mod import
Creating a mod package is pretty simple, just follow the video down below and you're done!

# Misc Guides
## Sort Mods in List
Sorting your Mod List is quite simple. Just go into the CSLoL-Manager where your skins are installed, and click edit on each individual item.
From there you can rename the skins to whatever sorting system you wish to have. By champions, by number or anything really. 

![edit_mod_list.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/edit_mod_list.webp)
Just keep in mind that everything is sorted alphabetically.

## Conflicting Mods
In case of conflicting mods, meaning that you have multiple mods that change the same file(s), but you want one mod’s files to be prioritised over the other.

What you do is simply, as mentioned above with regard to managing your mods, you rename the mod you want to prioritise over the other so that it is at the top of the list.

Then you go into CSLoL-Manager’s setting and enable “Suppress Install Conflicts”.

![conflicting_mods.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/conflicting_mods.webp)

And that’s it! Now when you run the mods, the files of the top mod will get prioritised and load first, whereas the other mods which got some of the same files edited, will only add those files they do not have in common. 

## Error Codes/ Messages
