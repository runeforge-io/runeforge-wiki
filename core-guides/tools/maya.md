### **Maya paid subscription**

If you want to buy a Maya subscription keep in mind, that you have 3 subscription plans (3 years, 1 year, 1 month). Make sure you are capable of buying the product, dont take financial risks since there is a free option with [Blender](/core-guides/tools-landing/blender).

To spare you some time, here is the pricing list (*02/07/2024*):

| Subscription Plans | Price | Price per month |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 Years | 5,625$ | 156,25$ |
| 1 Year | 1,875$ | 156,25$ |
| 1 Month | 235$   | 235$         |

Also those prices are paid in **advance** so the full price for the whole time period is paid at once.

# **Install LoL-Maya**

First download LoL-Maya [here](https://github.com/tarngaina/lol_maya/releases/tag/4.2.8).

Once you choose any way of getting a Maya License, you simply follow their installation instructions. 

In order to modify League of Legends models, animations or rigs, you need a Plugin called [LoL-Maya](core-guides/tools-landing/maya/lol-maya) by [Tarngaina](https://github.com/tarngaina).

```plaintext
Download lol_maya_(version_nr).zip
```

Make sure you always use the “latest” Version as shown in green next to the Version number.

Next, put those files into you Maya plugins folder. Depending on which version you installed (2023 and above) the folder would be here: `Documents/Maya/2023` (Year can change depending on what version you installed).

Once you've done that, you can open Maya and go into the **Plugin Manager**.
`Windows` > `Settings/Preferences` > `Plug-in Manager`

From there, search for `lol_maya` and check both *loaded* and *auto load.*

And thats it, click close and either restart or click refresh and close the Plugin manager. 

You can check if it worked when a **LolMaya and LolMaya\_MAPGEO** tab were created at the main bar of Maya.
