# Installing

- [Download Ritobin *by moonshadow*](https://github.com/moonshadow565/ritobin/releases)
{.links-list}

When installing the program, make sure that you have the latest release installed, you can confirm as such on github:
![ritogit.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/ritogit.webp)

Extract the contents into a folder you have specifically made for the tool and your .bin files.


# Converting .bin

Once you have saved a .bin file in your preferred location, what you'll need to do is go to where you have extracted Ritobin and open the Ritobin_gui application. 
From there the application will open up so you can find where you have saved your .bin file.

![ritofile.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/ritofile.webp)

After you have selected the .bin file you wish to modify, Ritobin will then ask you where to save the converted .bin file. 
The converted .bin will be saved in a readable .py file which you can open and modify in any normal text editor or your preferred coding software. 

# Converting back to .bin

Once you have finished modifying your .bin file and you are ready to put it into [CSLoL-Manager](/core-guides/tools/cslolmanager) for a test run, all you need to do is go back to your Ritobin folder where you drag and drop the modified .py file into the Ritobin.cli application.

![convert_to__bin.webp](/user-pictures/vector/new-post-guide/convert_to__bin.webp)

It will then convert the .py file back into .bin where it is ready to be used.
