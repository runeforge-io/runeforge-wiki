	 - Custom Hashes = CDTB Hashes + Extracted Hashes + User Manually Added Hashes

  ## no_skin

![noskin.png](/user-pictures/bud/noskin.png)
    
  Use it by clicking "Browse Champions folder" button and locating the Champions folder inside the game installation address.
>The address should look like this: "\Riot Games\League of Legends\Game\DATA\FINAL\Champions"
>{.is-info}
  
Press the Start button and select the folder where you want the mod to be created.
  
  After the operation is completed select the .fantome file you got and put it in CsLol or cslmao.
