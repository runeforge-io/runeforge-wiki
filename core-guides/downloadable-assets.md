## unpiewad
Small Tool which removes extensions like `.Pie_C_13_10.dds` or `.briar.dds`.

How to use it:
1. download and place inside the Ritobin folder.
2. Create a text file named allow.depie next to the folder that contains your assets and data like this (this is a safety feature)
3. Drop your wad folder, in this case Example.wad.client onto unpiewad.exe
