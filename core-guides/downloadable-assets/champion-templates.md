# Champion templates
## Preparing the images
Loading screen splash is sized 308x560.
In-game circle and square are sized 120x120.

Prepare the images you plan to use.
## Loading screen template
Templates for all 3 softwares will open up to 2 layers, simply paste the image you want into the first layer and adjust it if needed.
## In-game square template
Templates for all 3 softwares will open up to 2 layers, simply paste the image you want into the first layer and adjust it if needed.
## In-game circle template
Templates for all 3 softwares will open up to 2 layers, paste the image you want into the first layer.
Adjust the image if needed and merge the layers.

Zoom into the image and you will see 2 red pixels at the top left and bottom right.
Use the circle selection tool to select exactly from one red pixel to the other.
Once selected, invert the selection and delete the selected part.





## Saving
Once finished merge layers if you didn't and save the files as DDS using Bc3/DXT5 in the correct path of your mod.

The path for the loading screen splash art:
<code>X_champion\assets\characters\X_champion\skins\skin_number</code>

The path for in-game circle and square:
<code>X_champion\assets\characters\X_champion\hud</code>
