  This option will create a mod that disabled (almost) all riot skins and turns every champion to the default skin.
  
  Use it by clicking "Browse Champions folder" button and locating the Champions folder inside the game installation address.
>The address should look like this: "\Riot Games\League of Legends\Game\DATA\FINAL\Champions"
>{.is-info}
  
Press the Start button and select the folder where you want the mod to be created.

  To convert .skn and .skl files to FBX simply add the .skn file with the button and the .skl will be added alongside it if it's in the same folder.
