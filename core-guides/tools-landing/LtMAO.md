  This option will create a mod that disabled (almost) all riot skins and turns every champion to the default skin.
  
  Use it by clicking "Browse Champions folder" button and locating the Champions folder inside the game installation address.
>The address should look like this: "\Riot Games\League of Legends\Game\DATA\FINAL\Champions"
>{.is-info}
  
Press the Start button and select the folder where you want the mod to be created.
  
  After the operation is completed select the .fantome file you got and put it in CsLol or cslmao.

  ## lol2fbx
  To convert .skn and .skl files to FBX simply add the .skn file with the button and the .skl will be added alongside it if it's in the same folder.
  
  Then press the skn->FBX button and you will get your FBX file.

  In order to convert the FBX back to .skn and .skl put the FBX in with the button and press FBX->skn.
  
  If you encounter an error in the logs look below to see what they mean and how to fix them.
