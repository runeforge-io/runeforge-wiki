The standard installation path would be: 
`C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Game`
Now press select and you're done!

# Install a Mod
Once you have the [CS-LoL-Manager](/core-guides/tools-landing/cslolmanager) set up, downloading mods is rather straightforward from then on. Simply take the [.zip](https://wiki.vecslab.com/en/specific-guide/filetypes#zip) or [.fantome](https://wiki.vecslab.com/en/specific-guide/filetypes#fantome) file that you downloaded on our site for the relevant skin, and drag and drop it into the program.

As you add the skin into the program, simply click the box to mark it as selected, and click run on the top right corner for it to run.

This is it! Click stop if you donâ€™t want to load the skins anymore, or reselect and add new skins to enjoy them all to your fullest.
