# *Frequently Asked Questions*

## Are custom skins safe to use?
> Riot has stated previously that Custom Skins are "Use at your own risk" as they cannot take responsibility if third parties provide you with any malware when using Custom Skins. 
That said, RuneForge is the safest Custom Skins platform with an active community and moderation team.
