# *Frequently Asked Questions*

## Are custom skins safe to use?
> Currently you will not be banned unless you play on the Korean server which was always more strict.
{.is-info}

Custom skins are safe to use for the time being as Vanguard is not implemented yet. You can get banned only on the Korean server as they have a history of being way more strict than other servers.

If you have seen or heard of people being banned for custom skins it is most likely a lie and they are banned for having a botted account.
## When will Vanguard be added?
> We do not know but we will keep the community updated with the info we get on our <a href="https://www.discord.gg/runeforge">Discord server</a>.
{.is-info}

Riot has not been clear regarding the Vanguard anti cheat implementation. They are pushing back the rollout date back. We update on any info we get right away.
## Missing skins?
> Some creators aren't active anymore and skins could have been lost to time.
{.is-info}

We have the Skin Recovery Forum on our <a href="https://www.discord.gg/runeforge">Discord server</a> for:
- Storing Skins
- Fixing Old Skins
- Looking For Skins

Our main goal is to recover skins people want, so they can appear on the website later on.
