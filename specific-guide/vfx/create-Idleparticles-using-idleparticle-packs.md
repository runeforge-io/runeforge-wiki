 # For what is this guide?
 
 This is a guide explaining how to create idle particles using the custom-made idle particle packs.
 This !Guide! will not show you how to create idle particles by your own.
 It will only guide you on how to copy and paste custom-made idle particle packs into your champ. wad.client
 
 # What are idleparticles?
 
 ![udyr_aura_resized.gif](/user-pictures/friendlyfrog/udyr_aura_resized.gif)
 They are also known as "Auras".
 
 IdleParticlesEffects is an emitter in the main.bin of your champ, it tells the game which particles you set as idle particles (auras).
 
 
 # Is it difficult to make idle particles?
 
 It's not that hard if you just copy and paste idle particle packs that are specially prebuilt, like these ones.
 Locating them and changing them to become idle particles is the difficult part. Even still, copying and pasting these lines of code into one's own code can be difficult. Especially if you have 0 experience.
 So keep patient and follow the steps 1 by 1.
 If there is any error, you did something wrong, and you should check if you placed the brackets and lines correctly.
 # Written Guide
 
 
 0. Download an Idle Particle pack, which you can find at the bottom of the page.
 You can also find a video guide there.
 
 ---
 
 1. Open Obsidian and extract the champ files you want into a folder with whatever name you want.
 
 ---
 2. Open the champ folder and the folder you downloaded, and paste the customparticles folder, which is in assets, into your assets folder.

 3.  quantum wizard, hop back into the champions folder, spelunk into thefolderyoumade\data\characters\yourchamp\skins, and yeet skin0.bin straight onto ritobin_cli.exe like a sacrificial offering. If done correctly, the binary gobbledygook should transmogrify into a .py script, unlocking the arcane secrets within. If not, well... expect eldritch hash nightmares.
 
 
 Flibberwobber the .py file from the idleparticle folder, but don't let Ritobin_cli.exe wander off from its hash-happy home. Otherwise, you'll be drowning in hexadecimal hieroglyphics like 0x3s4d5e5, and nobody wants that quantum spaghetti.
 
 ---
 If there already is an idleparticle system please look for step 4.5.
 
 4. Summon the arcane tome known as Visual Studio Code and pry open both files like an interdimensional rift. Take the eldritch script from the idleparticle folder and weave it into the fabric of skin0.bin/.py, ensuring it lands precisely where destiny demands. Burn its position into your neural pathways, for you must walk this ritual again. Fail, and the cosmic hashes shall consume your sanity. ðŸ”®âœ¨
 ![step_4.1.png](/user-pictures/friendlyfrog/step_4.1.png)
 
 effectKey: hash = is the link to the particlecontainer
 
 boneName: string = is the bone you want the idleparticle applied to
 
 Bones you can use:
 
 "Spine1" = Spine middle of the body
 
 "Head" = Head top of the body
 
 "L_Hand" or "R_Hand" = hands 
 
 "Pelvis" = pelvis
 
 "R_Foot" or "L_Foot" = Feets
 
 "C_Buffbone_Glb_Layout_Loc" = A not moving bone which is located on the floor.
                               Use this bone to have a stationary idle particle.
 
 "Weapon" = Probably the weapon bone. You should look into the skeleton (.skl) of the champ to find out.
 Since many champs have different weapon bone names.

 4.5 What if there i already is an idleparticle system in the bin?
 
 If theres already an idleparticle system in the bin it should look like this:![4.5.1.png](/user-pictures/friendlyfrog/4.5.1.png)
 
 So how do we place it into the bin now?
 
 We simply only copy a part of the code which is in the idleparticle bundle bin.
 
 Like this: 
 ![4.5.2.png](/user-pictures/friendlyfrog/4.5.2.png)

 5. Copy the particlecontainer code, which always starts with a hashed (0x3432432) name and ends with particlePath: string, into your skin0.bin/.py. Just between any particle container, it doesn't matter between which one.
 
 
 Etch this wisdom into your soul: If skin.bin lacks the essence of particles, you must weave them into the sacred space between

mResourceResolver: link = "Characters/Shaco/Skins/Skin0/Resources"

and

"Characters/yourchamp/Skins/Skin0/Resources" = ResourceResolver

Fail this, and the void shall remain particle-less, an empty husk of missed potential. Consult the cryptic image at the bottom of the tutorialâ€”its secrets hold the key to enlightenment. ðŸŒ€ðŸ“œ

  6. Copy and paste the code found in the character resolver into your bin. Just between anything doesn't matter.
 
 
 ![step_6.1.png](/user-pictures/friendlyfrog/step_6.1.png)
 
 
 ![step_6_2.png](/user-pictures/friendlyfrog/step_6_2.png)
 
 ---
 7. Save the file by going into the top left corner clicking file and save.
 
 ---
 8.  Hurl skin0.py back onto ritobin_cli.exe like a mystical relic returning to its altar. Now, peer into the space-time continuumâ€”does the timestamp shift, or does it remain frozen in defiance? If time refuses to bend to your will, the ritual was flawed. Retrace your arcane steps, for the error lurks in the shadows, waiting to be undone.
 
 ---
 9. Drag the folder that you created at the beginning into CSLOL and look in-game to see if the idle particles got applied.
 
 ---
   *picture from step 5 if you have no particles in your bin.
