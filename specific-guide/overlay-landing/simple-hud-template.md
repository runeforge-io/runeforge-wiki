# Simple HUD Template

## Infos

The layers (should) have the same name in all of the .psd files.They are also color coded:

| Color | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|<span style="color:yellow">Yellow:</span>| Metal parts|

|<span style="color:green">Green:</span>| Background textures (mostly hidden by images, I recommend recoloring them anyways)|

|<span style="color:purple">Violet:</span>| Main color (usually indicators)|

|<span style="color:red">Red:</span>| Indicates areas that are always hidden by something (e.g. abilities). Has to be turned invisible before exporting.|

|<span style="color:blue">Blue:</span>| Indicates areas that are sometimes hidden (e.g. item slots). Has to be turned invisible before exporting.|

|<span style="color:gray">Gray:</span>| You do not need to edit that layer at all and they are usually locked, however, you can turn it invisible if you want to, unless it says (Leave untouched).|

|Uncolored: |Folders containing all the image areas you can drop in your image.|
<br>
There will also be gray colored folders called “Empty layers for actions (Ignore)”. They are needed in order to not break when batch processing the template.
