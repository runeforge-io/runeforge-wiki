This tutorial teaches how you can copy weights from your own skin (if you need to redo something) or from an original Riot skin (if you do not want to fully weight your skin yourself).
Sometimes you mess up and need to unbind your skin again and copying weights saves you from having to do them over.

You can also take original Riot weights to save some time.
