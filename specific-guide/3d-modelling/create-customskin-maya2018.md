# Installing Riotfiletranslator
**Important Note**
The .env file is not fully correct in this video! If you do it like this you cannot load weighted models!It is missing the \others in the path for scripts. **This is how it has to look (depends on your placement ofc, just the paths in red have to be the same)**: 
`MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH = D:\Dokumente\Maya plugins\Maya 2018\bin\plug-ins`
`MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH = D:\Dokumente\Maya plugins\Maya 2018\scripts\others`
`XBMLANGPATH = D:\Dokumente\Maya plugins\Maya 2018\icons`
*Path's may vary*
