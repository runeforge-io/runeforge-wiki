This tutorial teaches you how to assign multiple materials to a skin properly.
A lot of the newer champions and skins require multiple materials. An indicator for that are assets, that are not always there, but for example only appear in the recall animation, like KDA Ahriâ€™s throne. Those champions and skins also usually have more than just the basic texture in the folder Skins/base.

While assigning materials you might run into a rare issue, which for example Kalista and Mordekaiser have: they have bones and materials that have the same name.
