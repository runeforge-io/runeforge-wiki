## Required Tools
 Any graphic editor that can handle .dds files

Something to view your model (not mandatory but very helpful)

-   [Autodesk Maya + LoLmaya *Program to create, edit, animate or rig 3D models*](/core-guides/tools/maya)

Or 

-   [Blender *Program to create, edit, animate or rig 3D models*](/core-guides/tools/blender)

## Infos
To delete small model parts you might not need to actually model edit. Simply making textures transparent might help in a lot of cases, but not all (Initially I wanted to delete Spirit Blossom Evelynn’s crown, which for some reason did not work).
