This tutorial shows you how your particles should break less often by including every particle texture and model in your mod and rerouting them to your championâ€™s particle folder. This can also help you find all particles your champion/skin uses.

Particles break and have blocky shapes due to Riot renaming files that you might not have edited, but they are from the game files.If your .bins are not from the same patch as the file was renamed in, your particles will break as the old bin cannot find the outdated filename, resulting in often blocky shapes and missing models.
