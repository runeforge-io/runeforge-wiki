Riot is in the process of updating League's main texture file format from DDS to TEX, updating groups of champions in alphabetical order. This causes mods to break because Riot's files are now looking for TEX files while your mod still includes irrelevant DDS files.

# Update Textures With LtMAO

## 1. Extract WAD from CSLOL Installed Folder

Find your mod's WAD file under CSLOL's installed folder at `CSLOL\installed\Mod_Name\WAD`.

## 2. Locate Texture Files and Convert DDS to TEX

1. First, you can delete alternate files, i.e., files beginning with `4x_` or `2x_` because TEX does not need alternate files to display at lower texture settings.
2. Convert each DDS file to TEX by right clicking it, selecting `LtMAO` then click `Ritoddstex: Convert To TEX`.
3. After you convert your files to TEX, you can delete any remaining DDS files. If LtMAO gives any errors like `Unsupported DDS format`, try converting to PNG using the same context menu, back to DDS, and finally to TEX. You can delete your remaining PNG files alongside the DDS files.
4. If there is a folder labeled `particles`, you need to convert DDS files there as well.

## 3. Repack Your WAD and Reload CSLOL

This should be it. If you did everything right, your textures should look normal again in game.

# Bulk Fix Large Mods (No LtMAO)

For crashing or invisible skins see step 3 and 4.

> You will need at least [tex2dds](https://github.com/Morilli/Ritoddstex/releases) by Morilli and it's a good idea to get [texconv](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases) by Microsoft. These are both small CLI utilities. Install both of these to a folder you can remember later.
{.is-info}

This tutorial uses CMD, but you can use PowerShell if you want, you just need to adjust the commands quite a bit as loops are not similar and some tools are not the same as in CMD. Also, to use Environment Variables in PowerShell you need to append `$env:` ex., `%pbe%` is `$env:pbe` in PowerShell.

## 1. Extract Your Mod and It's WAD File
Extract your mod's Fantome or Zip file to a folder using 7-Zip or WinRAR. To add 7-Zip options to your context menu follow this guide [Fix 7-Zip Option Missing From Context Menu](https://www.intowindows.com/fix-7-zip-option-missing-from-context-menu/). Additionally, for easier access to your mod's files in the future, set Fantome files to open by default with 7-Zip or WinRAR.

![extract_&_open.png](/user-pictures/moga/extract_&_open.png =x250)

Under your extracted folder, `Mod_Name\WAD` you will find all of your mod's files compressed within a single WAD file, labeled `Champion.wad.client` or `Champion.en_US.wad.client`. Extract a WAD by dragging it onto one of CSLOL's tools called `wad-extract`, found in your CSLOL directory under `CSLOL\cslol-tools\wad-extract`. This extracts your mod's files into a folder called `Champion.wad` next to your WAD file. It may be necessary to have updated hashes and their full pathnames in your `wad-extract` directory, although some files may be custom or no known hash regardless. Unknown hashes will not prevent you from converting or editing your files, but without them you may inadvertently edit files, such as any QWER+P icons because they are largely indistinguishable while not labeled and in their directory.

> Similar to the technique used above to open Fantomes with 7-Zip, you can do the same for WAD files with the extension `.client` and `wad-extract`. Now, double clicking a WAD file has `wad-extract` extract it into a folder next to your WAD.

## 2. Convert DDS to TEX in Bulk Without LtMAO
> Before bulk converting, you should understand a few details about TEX and DDS files in league. ***As of the 25.5 patch***, 
> - Only champions who's name begin with A-J use TEX files for their textures and particles. This means AoE converting with a loop will incorrectly convert some of these files, ex., if a Caitlyn mod uses textures in a Zed folder. This is less common, and a more specific command can be used to work around this.
> - Most files found under `assets\shared` do not need to be TEX and should be left alone if they are.
> - ***Every*** champion, even A-J, still uses DDS files for their QWER+P icons (found under `champ.wad\assets\characters\champ\hud\icons2d`).
> - ***Every*** champion uses TEX for their loadscreen found in the main folder and in game profile pictures found in `champ.wad\assets\characters\champ\hud`.

First, you need to add both `tex2dds` and `texconv` to your Windows path in order to use them from within any directory, otherwise, they will only be available while inside the folder they were installed to. To do this, search `env var` from your Windows start menu and click `Edit the system environment variables` or follow this video guide since default windows search is garbage.

Using tex2dds manually by dragging each file, from the cli like `tex2dds file.tex` to create `file.dds`, or using LtMAO's context menu is impractical.
Navigate **inside** of your `champion.wad` folder, press `Ctrl+L` or click to focus the address bar in file explorer, type `cmd`, and press enter to open a command prompt at your current location. Your CMD path should end with `champ.wad`.

![open_cmd_here.gif](/user-pictures/moga/open_cmd_here.gif =x325)

To convert every single DDS file in a directory to TEX, or vice versa, shrimply run this for command inside `champ.wad`. Make sure you understand the four highlighted notes above.
`for /R %I in (*dds) do tex2dds "%I"` If this fails with an error, appears blank/white in game, or wont load and crashes, see step 3 and 4.
- `for` is the basic loop command used in CMD to iterate on a conditional set of files.
- `/R` is a for loop switch that indicates to loop recursively.
- `%I` represents the currently active file.
- `(*dds)` uses the `*` wildcard to signify a file that begins with literally anything and ends in `dds`.

> Once you're comfortable with the command line, append `&& del "%I"` in order to delete your DDS file after converting to TEX. Alternatively, if you would prefer to not delete anything rapidly, wait until after you have updated your mod and run `for /R %I in (*dds) do del "%I"` to delete any remaining DDS files. Again, make sure you know what files exist in your mod and whether they may need to be DDS or TEX.

Next, on the same command line, run `for /R %I in (4x*tex,2x*tex,4x*dds,2x*dds) do del "%I"` to delete your now redundant `4x_` and `2x_` alternative texture files.

If this completed successfully, you can go to Step 5 to remake your WAD file and try it in game. 

## 3. Optional: Fix Bad DDS Pixel Format
> There are two requirements for a DDS file to correctly convert to a league TEX file. It must be in a DXT1, DXT5, or uncompressed BGRA8 format and it's X and Y dimensions must both be multiples of 4.
{.is-info}

This step can also be used to pre-fix any potentially bad DDS files before converting them to TEX.

In most cases, simply converting all DDS files to TEX with `tex2dds` will have worked, but if both of the above criteria are not met, your TEX file will either simply fail to convert and produce an error such as `Error: dds file needs to be in either DXT1, DXT5 or uncompressed BGRA8 format!`, appear invisible or whited out in game, or fail to load and crash League.

![saved_bad_dds.png](/user-pictures/moga/saved_bad_dds.png =x200)

- Type `texconv` with no options to see all available switches.

Now, run `texconv -f BC3_UNORM -r:keep -y *dds` to iterate on all DDS files below your current directory. If you mess this up, just delete the `Champ.wad` folder and re-extract the WAD file to start over.
- `-f` is the output pixel format flag and `BC3_UNORM` is the specified format. All of the formats are listed at the bottom of the texconv help output.
- `-r` is texconv's recursive switch. `:keep` leaves the output file in the same spot as it was before conversion, otherwise texconv will put the converted file into your current directory (bad!)
- `-y` overwrites your old/input file with the converted/output file.
- `*dds` uses a CMD wildcard to provide texconv with every file that begins with anything and ends in `dds`.

![img_of_texconv_cmd.png](/user-pictures/moga/img_of_texconv_cmd.png)

> While using `texconv`, it is important you are not in any random directory while using it because `-r` combined with the `*` wildcard will tell texconv to do **every** file under you. **If you want to work on a directory you are not inside of, you need to provide an output DIRECTORY to texconv with `-o`** Ex., `texconv -f BC3_UNORM -r:keep -y -o Mod_Name\folder" "Mod_Name\folder\*dds"`
Until you understand this command you should make sure you are under `Champ.wad` like the above image!
{.is-warning}

## 4. Optional: Fix Bad DDS Dimension(s)

This section is slightly more nuanced and may seem confusing, but in the end it is 1-2 commands and little reading.

After confirming your DDS files are in the BC3_UNORM format and converting them to TEX, they may still fail to appear as expected in game. This is uncommon, and is because the X & Y coordinates of your DDS file were not a multiple of 4 before converting to TEX. To confirm this, use [texdiag](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases) from the initial texconv link and run `texdiag info "file.dds"`. The output will include various information about your input file.

![texdiag_out.png](/user-pictures/moga/texdiag_out.png)

The above image is a great example of a DDS file that might look like it has proper dimensions because of the even numbers and therefore should not create issues, but instead, it will 1. not not convert to TEX because of the pixel format, and 2. even if the format was compatible with `tex2dds`, tex2dds would simply create a TEX file that does not work in game because of it's improper dimensions.

To fix this file you need to convert the DDS' pixel format to `BC3_UNORM` as explained in Step 3, and adjust the dimensions. To adjust dimensions, use the `-w` and `-h` switches for width and height, so `texconv -w 300 -h 304 -y "file.dds"`. If the offending file is a loadscreen, their default dimensions are `308x560`.

Do note that adjusting—and especially ever so slightly changing the aspect ratio of very small files—such as an icon with the size 111x94 to 112x96 will create **very** apparent resampling artifacts. In order to preserve image quality, it may be better to actually crop pixels from a specific side of the image using a photo editor such as [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/). Cropping instead of resizing is usually only necessary for for static images like icons or decals with text, whereas resizing an erroneous mod's champion texture from 258x256 to 256x256 is unlikely to produce noticeable discrepancies in game. If the texture is a part of the game involving heavy movement or is otherwise not a static icon, then any resampling blur will not be noticeable in the final TEX texture.

![fukt_up_resize.png](/user-pictures/moga/fukt_up_resize.png =x220)

As seen in the image above, the right side image, having been resized to 112x96, has very visible artifacting, especially around it's jagged border. If I were to instead crop or extend the the original image's canvas (in accordance with the proper TEX dimensions), it will likely have no or extremely minor adjustments in game; and completely avoid the risk of resample blur ruining the image. The results of cropping can vary on the type of image, for example, an image used as an animation graphic like `kayn_spritesatlas_02`; even cropping or adding only a single pixel may completely alter it's animation in game.

> Remember, if the input file provided to `texconv` is not in your current directory, i.e., the input file `"path\path\*.dds"`, you need to provide an output path, `-o "path\path"` before. Also note that `texconv` will only output to preexisting directories.
{.is-info}

If you are unable to find the broken file(s) manually there is simple way to find them.
1. Run `texdiag info -r *dds>>%desktop%\all.txt`, into a text file. Note `%desktop%` is an example path, change that directory and filename to one for your drive.
2. Next, do `texdiag info -r *dds | findstr "width height">>%desktop%\sizes.txt` which uses FINDSTR to filter just the lines including width and height information.
3. Open `sizes.txt` and globally (ie, not just concurrently) remove duplicate lines with your text editor's tool, `Ctrl+Shift+D` in Notepad++. This creates a brief list of each unique dimension from your pool of DDS files.

![npp_sizes.png](/user-pictures/moga/npp_sizes.png)

As you can see from this list, there are two obvious values that are not compatible with TEX. Using this information you can go to `all.txt` and search your faulty height and/or width to find the file(s) with incorrect dimensions.

This is a very underdeveloped shortcut to finding bad files and with better filters and some conditionals you could easily make something that prints out offending files instead of finding them manually.

## 5. Remake WAD and Repack Mod File

Before remaking your mod, test your fix by simply dragging your `Champ.wad` **folder** (not .client file) into CSLOL. It will load normally if you drag the correct folder, and it's name will be `Champion` with no description or other metadata information.

Once you confirm your fix works as expected, follow similar steps as before when you extracted your WAD.
1. Drag the `Champ.wad` onto `wad-make`. This will overwrite the `Champ.wad.client` file.
2. Delete the `Champ.wad` folder.
3. Go up a directory, select both META and WAD, right click, and click "Add to archive". If this is not available, follow this guide [Fix 7-Zip Option Missing From Context Menu](https://www.intowindows.com/fix-7-zip-option-missing-from-context-menu/).
You can also use 7-Zip from CMD assuming it's part of your PATH. To make a structurally correct mod use `7z a "Mod_Name.zip" META WAD RAW` while inside the directory with those folders leaving you with a zip file as your mod next to your WAD/META/RAW folders. You need to know exactly where you are when you run this or make the zip manually because if you nest or otherwise make an incorrect mod structure, upon importing the mod into CSLOL it will simply error out.
4. After you have successfully made your Zip file, *and optionally rename the extension to `fantome` for fun*, you can use your mod in CSLOL. A Fantome file is a Zip file with additional information about the file, and is unnecessary at all.
5. Profit.
