Riot is slowly changing textures to tex, causing mods to break. This is a tutorial on how to fix them.

## 1. Find your mod in the cslol installed folder and extract the wad.

## 2. Find your textures and convert them using LtMAO
If you find any 2x,4x files, delete them. After converting the files to tex, you can delete every dds file.

## 3. Repack your wad, then restart cslol.
If the wad change date changes, you can delete your folder.
