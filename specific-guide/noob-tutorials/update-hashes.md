Hashes are required for three main tools, [Obsidian](https://github.com/Crauzer/Obsidian), [Ritobin](/https://github.com/moonshadow565/ritobin/releases), and built-in CSLOL tools like `wad-extract` found in your CSLOL directory `CSLOL\cslol-tools`.

Obsidian and Ritobin both use a folder in it's installed directory called `hashes` to store it's hash files. CSLOL simply includes it's hash files next to the tool files in `cslol-tools`.

# Method 1: Take hashes from Obsidian

Probably the easiest method, but also the slowest way to get hashes for ritobin or cslol-tools is to have obsidian auto-update it's hashes and then copy it's hashes into your tool's folderr.
