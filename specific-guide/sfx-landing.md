# Sound Effects
## Point 1: Basic information.
League of Legends, like many games, have a complex yet effective system to compress files that makes the game posible to run. Specificaly in the audio system, there are many layers of compression being made. To access the neat files of the game we have to follow some instructions (go to point 4 to skip all the information).
## Point 2: Formats of files.
For sound modding in League of Legends we use these type of files:
- .wav: Generic audio file format used before converting into the format that League of Legends can read.
- .wem: File format that the game reads. You can not use any other type of audio format to replace sounds
- .bin: Code that reads every .wem file and makes the logic to get it to work in game; something like the brain of the game. (Not only used for sounds)
- .bnk: Format that contains all the compressed .wem files that a model can have. There are two distinctions of the formats: "events.bnk" and "audio.bnk"
