# Tutorial 

## Adding the .wav files to Wwise2019.1.11
First, drag your `.wav` audio files into `Actor-Mixer Hierarchy` > `Default Work Unit*`, then click `Import`. 

Make sure all sounds are set to `Sound SFX`. and the `Audio Tab` is open shown on the left side.

## Creating the Events
Then, select all the `SFX` that you've dragged in, right-click, hover over `New Event (One Event per Object)`, and select `Play`.

Next, go to the `Events tab` to check if the events for each audio have been created.

## Creating the Soundbanks for both Audio and Events
Then, go to the `SoundBanks tab`, right-click on `Default Work Unit*`, hover over `New Child`, and select `Soundbank`. 

Name the first soundbank something like `champion_sfx_audio` for the audio soundbank. 

After creating the first soundbank, copy and paste it, then rename the copy to something like `champion_sfx_events` for the events soundbank.

Now press `F7` to open the Soundbank Manager in the middle, where you can see the two soundbanks inside.

## Adding the audios and the events to the soundbanks

**Audio SoundBank:**

In the `SoundBanks Manager`, select `champion_sfx_audio`. You'll notice that the `Hierarchy Inclusion` is empty. 

While `champion_sfx_audio` is still selected in the `SoundBank Manager`, go to the `Audio Tab` and select all the audios that you've uploaded. 

Add them to the `champion_sfx_audio's hierarchy inclusion`. 

Then, select all of them and uncheck both `Events` and `Structures` and leave `Media` checked.

**Events SoundBank:**

For the events, the process is the same as adding the audios to the `champion_sfx_audio`, but for this one, you’ll want to drag both the audios and events into the `champion_sfx_events' hierarchy inclusion`. 

In the `SoundBanks Manager`, select `champion_sfx_events`. You'll notice that the `Hierarchy Inclusion` is empty. 

While `champion_sfx_events` is still selected in the `SoundBank Manager`, go to the `Audio Tab` and select all the audios that you've uploaded. 

Add them to the `champion_sfx_events' hierarchy inclusion`. 

Now, go to the `Events tab`, select all the events you've created, and add them to the `champion_sfx_events' hierarchy inclusion`.

Then, select all of them and uncheck only the `Media`.

## Generating the audio and events soundbank files

Lastly, once you're ready, select both of your soundbanks, `champion_sfx_audio` and `champion_sfx_events`, and click `Generate All`. A window will pop up, and once it's done generating, you can click `Close`. 

After returning to the `SoundBank Manager`, right-click on any of your soundbanks, hover over `Open Containing Folder`, and select the `.bnk file`. 

This will open the folder, and you'll see your custom soundbank files. 

Now, it's time to add it to your custom skin.

# Additional Tips

## Adjusting Speaker Panning / 3D Spatialzation

Before we generate the audio and events soundbanks, let's first adjust the `3D spatialization` of the audio so it won't be heard across the entire Summoner's Rift.

First, open the `Audio Tab` and select one of your audio files to edit. Once selected, open the `Sound Property Editor` by pressing `F5`, and this window will appear.

![image_2024-12-09_215607665.png](/user-pictures/nyht/image_2024-12-09_215607665.png)

Next, switch tab from the `General Settings` tab to `Positioning`, and you'll see this. What you want to do is enable `Listener Relative Routing`, set `3D Spatialization` to `Position + Orientation`, and then check `Attenuation`.

![image_2024-12-09_215828087.png](/user-pictures/nyht/image_2024-12-09_215828087.png)

Now you would want to click that double arrow and press `New...`

![image_2024-12-09_220059422.png](/user-pictures/nyht/image_2024-12-09_220059422.png)

The `New Attenuation` window will pop up. We want to create our own so we don’t have to repeat this step for the others. Name it something like `League_Audio3D`, and then click `OK.`

![image_2024-12-09_220301661.png](/user-pictures/nyht/image_2024-12-09_220301661.png)

Now, once you've created the `Attenuation`, click `Edit....`

![image_2024-12-09_220544127.png](/user-pictures/nyht/image_2024-12-09_220544127.png)

Now that the `Attenuation Editor` has opened, go to `Properties` and scroll down until you see `Spread`. Click the dropdown for `Spread` and select `Custom`. You will then see only the green line graph.

Next, set the `Max Distance` to `2650` `(from 100)`, and double-click the middle of the graph to create a dot.

Set the coordinates of the middle dot to `X: 30`, `Y: 0`.

Lastly, select the other dot located at `Y: 100`. Right-click on it and select `Logarithmic (Base 3)`.

After doing this, your graph should look like the screenshot below, and you can exit the window.

![image_2024-12-09_220754525.png](/user-pictures/nyht/image_2024-12-09_220754525.png)

After setting up the `Attenuation`, your `Positioning` should look like this. Now, repeat these steps for your other audio files. Don't worry—the `Attenuation` you just created and edited is saved, so you can use it again without needing to recreate the graphs for each.

![image_2024-12-09_221600707.png](/user-pictures/nyht/image_2024-12-09_221600707.png)

Once you're done with all of that, you can go back and generate your soundbanks!
