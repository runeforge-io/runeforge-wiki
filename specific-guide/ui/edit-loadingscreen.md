# Create custom loadingscreen

This guide teaches you how to change the loading screen background to any background you like.

## Required Tools

- [Any 2D editing program *Any tool which can handle .dds files*](/core-guides/tools#texturing)
- [Template *External Link*](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ulwhlqwju0ab5tz/Loading_Screen_Template.zip/file)
{.links-list}

>During events like worlds, there will be a different loading screen that you can also replace. Theoretically you can replace any loading screen as long as you can find it in obsidian (urf, tft, etc). I will not be covering these, though.

## Preparation
Download the template provided and prepare the image you plan to use as the background.

## Creation
Open the template you have downloaded and go to Map11 folder and get srbackground.tex.

You will convert the srbackground file using [tex2dds](/core-guides/tools/ritoddstex).

Open the DDS file you got in the image editing program of choice.
Take the image you prepared and copy it over the background.
You can use any file thats 1024x512 or larger.


## Saving
Save your file as a DDS again and make sure its saved using Bc3/DXT5.

Drag the DDS file on [tex2dds](/core-guides/tools/ritoddstex) to get the .tex file back.
You can leave the DDS file in your mod or delete it if you wish.
### Howling abyss
If you want to use the same background for the Howling abyss map you will just need to copy the .tex file you got and rename it to habackground.tex.
If you wish to make it different you will follow the same process as the one for Summoners Rift.
### Cslol Notice
If you are using a custom map mod which changes the loading screen, name your mod in Cslol with a 0 in front so that its at the top and make sure "Suppress install conflicts" setting is enabled.
This will ensure that your loading screen is applied.

### Breaking down gifs frame by frame

First off all, what we want to do is split our gif or video into single individual frames. You can use [Bloggif](https://es.bloggif.com/gif-extract) for this if you're planning to use a GIF.

Once we have the gifs broken down into images, you have to pick exactly 32 of them. Keep in mind that you can repeat frames if you're just short of 32.

Next you're going to open your graphic editor of preference (In this guide [Photoshop](/core-guides/tools/adobe/photoshop) will be used). Bear in mind that the graphic editor must be able to handle transparent backgrounds, as we're working with sprites.

 
### Placing the frames in the template

After you finish importing ["Guide Photoshop.psd"](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4u5xju7f0ntpddf/Gu%25C3%25ADa_Photoshop.psd/file) or ["Guide PNG"](https://www.mediafire.com/view/q4eu2vtq7z7jrrj/Gu%25C3%25ADa_PNG.png/file) into your graphic editor of choice, you'll begin placing every frame in their respective slot.

The red bar counts as the limit of each frame. Feel free to occupy as much space in every individual block as you can.

Once done, we have to get rid of the template and save the file as a .dds using the [Intel&reg; Texture Works](/core-guides/tools/adobe/photoshop#intel-texture-works) or [Nvidia Texture Tools](/core-guides/tools/adobe/photoshop#nvidia-texture-tools).
If you aren't using Photoshop you can use [this online converter](https://www.convertidor.es/png-a-dds#:~:text=Como%20convertir%20de%20PNG%20a%20DDS%3A%20Convertidor%20de,Pulsa%20en%20Descargar%20para%20obtener%20tu%20archivo%20convertido) or any other application that can save a DDS file.

 
### Converting .dds files to .tex

You will need to convert the [.dds](/specific-guide/filetypes#dds) file to [.tex](/specific-guide/filetypes#tex). You will need [tex2dds](/core-guides/tools/ritoddstex) for this.

When the conversion is done, we'll change the name of the file to "loadingscreen_spinner_atlas" (without quotations). After that, you will want to create a few folders. It should look something like this:
<kbd style="background-color:#343942">[FOLDER WITH YOUR MOD NAME]/assets/ux/loadingscreen/loadingscreen_spinner_atlas.tex</kbd>
