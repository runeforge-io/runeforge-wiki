# How to fix broken animations with LoLmaya
Common issues that can appear are: bugged animations that just don’t look properly, champions walking backwards/sidewards or smth

For Jhin, his reload animation is horribly bugged if you export it normally:

## Required Tools

-   [Obsidian *Main program to extract and browse Leagues gamefiles.*](/core-guides/tools/obsidian)
-   [Autodesk Maya *Program to create, edit, animate or rig 3D models*](/core-guides/tools/maya)
- [LoL-Maya *Plugin made by tarngaina*](https://github.com/tarngaina/lol_maya)

# Written Guide

## How to get a Riot .skl file
First extract the original champion <a href="/en/specific-guide/filetypes#skn">.skl</a> file from Obsidian, following the tutorial above. You only need the <a href="/en/specific-guide/filetypes#skn">.skl</a>. In my case, it’s Jhin.skl

Rename the <a href="/en/specific-guide/filetypes#skn">.skl</a> to Riot.skl and place it in the champion skin folder of your custom skin. I rename Jhin.skl to Riot.skl and put it into Jhin.wad.client/assets/characters/jhin/skins/base.

## Exporting your skin
Load your finished skin in Maya. You have to have all the weighting done.

Now export your model as “Riot skn/skl” format in Maya with whatever name you want (except “riot” ofc).
In the bottom right/Script Editor you will see this. This means it worked.

Delete the riot.skl file.
