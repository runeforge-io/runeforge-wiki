# Introduction

Creating a mapskin for League is easier than it looks, since it shares alot of similarities with creating a custom skin. However, it takes alot of time and effort to create one, since there are alot more assets which you need to edit.

So before you start, we **highly recommend** you to check out the [Beginner Guides](/core-guides/get-started) in order to understand how editing League content works in general.
This guide is not for beginners in modding, however it is made for beginners in modding League maps!

## Disclaimer

Editing League maps can lead to many problems. Since this is the playground of the game, its better to create them with a plan or to test things out. Editing textures like in this guide is an easier task.
