# Introduction

Creating a mapskin for League is easier than it looks, since it shares alot of similarities with creating a custom skin. However, it takes alot of time and effort to create one, since there are alot more assets which you need to edit.

So before you start, we **highly recommend** you to check out the [Beginner Guides](/core-guides/get-started) in order to understand how editing League content works in general.
This guide is not for beginners in modding, however it is made for beginners in modding League maps!

## Disclaimer

Editing League maps can lead to many problems. Since this is the playground of the game, its better to create them with a plan or to test things out. Editing textures like in this guide is an easier task.


# Tools

The following tools are needed to edit the map **textures**.

- [Obsidian *To extract files*](/core-guides/tools/obsidian) 
{.links-list}

**OR *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:***
- [Mapskin template *Base Template recommended*](/core-guides/downloadable-assets#templates)
- [Any 2D editing software *which can handle editing .dds files*](/core-guides/tools#texturing)
{.links-list}

# Guide

*Before we start, all nessecary files you need are in our templates. We wont discuss any needed files further in this guide, since Riot has alot of files which aren't used anymore in there. You can use the template for free and add/ remove all files you dont want to edit. In our guide, we work with the template, however the folder structure is the same as if you export it yourself*

## Ground Textures

Filepath: `\assets\maps\kitpieces\srx`

In there are multiple folder which are the ground texture pieces.

### Editing

In order to edit those textures, you need a 2D editing software which can handle .dds files.
