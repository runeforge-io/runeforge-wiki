# Apply as Contributor

In order for you to post pages, you need the **Contributor** role. As a Contributor you are allowed to add, edit and complete existing or new pages. You, however, can't edit major pages like "home".

## What do I need as a Contributor?

The following tasks and skills are nessecary in order to be accepted:

- Knowledge with **Markdown**
- Knowledge about any part of modding League of Legends (Guides, Filetypes, Programs, etc)

The wiki is in English, means you need to write you whole guide in English.

## Rules

- No hatespeech/ racism/ trolling/ etc.
- Only edit in Markdown
- Don't add scripts, CSS or HTML Code. Exceptions are allowed if accepted by Mods or Admins
- Link the pages properly, we provided a Guide on how to do so.

## Application

The application is simple, DM @Vector or @Crauzer in Discord, write something about you and how you want to contribute. Also you need to be registered here at the wiki (You can do that [here](https://wiki.vecslab.com/login)). State your Wiki username and then you're done =)
