# Runeforge 2.0 is here

Runeforge came a long way, now we want to present Runeforge 2.0. Please note, that the website is still in BETA. Bugs and missing functions can still occur. If you notice a bug, please let us know on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/runeforge) Server!

# How to become a Creator

### Step 1 Register Account
 
- Create an Account by clicking "register" in the top right corner

### Create a Mod

*See [how to post a Mod](/runeforge2#how-to-post-a-mod)*

- Go to your dashboard (top right corner and click dashboard)
- Click "Create mod" & follow the steps

### Review your mod

- Once finished, click "Send for Review"

After some time, once the mod got reviewed, you can get either of the following responses:

- **Review rejected**
We tell you why your mod got rejected, fix those issues and resend for another review

After you got your first mod approved, you can continue to post more afterwards without the waittime. You also automatically get the Creator role on your account.

## Which License should I use?

Licensing can be complicated, in order to understand what you want to allow user and what not, put the "Name" into the License field on Runeforge. 

Example: 
You want you skin to only be played by users and not used for commercial use, then choose one license which prohibits commercial use like **CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0**.

<br>

| Name                | Credit			   | Commercial Use | Modifications Allowed | Share-Alike Required |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| CC-BY-4.0           | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :green_circle:        | :red_circle:         |
| CC-BY-SA-4.0 				| :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :green_circle:        | :green_circle:       |
| CC-BY-NC-4.0        | :green_circle: | :red_circle:   | :green_circle: 				| :red_circle:				 |
| CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0     | :green_circle: | :red_circle:   | :green_circle: 				| :green_circle: 			 |
| CC-BY-ND-4.0      	| :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :red_circle:          | :red_circle:				 |
| CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0     | :green_circle: | :red_circle:   | :red_circle: 					| :red_circle: 				 |

:green_circle: : Yes

# FAQ

## Safety & Security

<br>

### Are custom skins safe to use?


- Riot's official statement is "Use at your own risk", which means, it is allowed to use them but Riot does not take responsibility with any third party problems occuring in game or affect your PC

- Runeforge has a moderation team and allows players to post mods for everyone else. We work with a Trusted status, which is a compromise between fast moderation and security

### Can I get banned for using custom skins?

- As of right now, no bans regarding skins provided by Runeforge are registered

- Custom skin bans occured on **Korea** servers, on which all third party apps are prohibited including cs-lol

- Cs-lol is not tested on **Chinese** servers, if you want to try it there, us at your own risk

- Bans can and will occur if you used "free" paid skins also know as [Skin Hacking](/runeforge2#can-i-get-paid-skins-through-custom-skins-skin-hacking)


### Vanguard was added, is it dangerous to use cs-lol?

- cs-lol does work with Vanguard, since its release in Patch 14.9, no bans or records regarding custom skins have been reported

<br>

## Skins

<br>

### My favorite skin is missing

Sometimes Creators leave the community or stop maintaining them. If the skin isn't on the website, you can try and ask in our Discord Skin recovery Forum for help.

### Can I get Paid skins through custom skins? (Skin Hacking)

No Skin hacking is prohibited by Riot Games. We highly recommend to not download and use those skins, since this can and will lead to bans from Runeforge and League of Legends.

<br>
