<h1>Runeforge.io &amp; wiki.Runeforge.io</h1>
<p>With the development of <strong>Runeforge.dev</strong>, we've taken a significant stride towards greater independence from third-party page builders and providers that often impose limitations. This transition means <strong>Runeforge.dev</strong> will now serve as the self-developed and self-managed web platform specifically tailored for League of Legends modders.</p>
<p><span class="text-big">This exciting change also includes an update to our wiki's address. The official <strong>wiki URL will change to wiki.Runeforge.</strong><mark class="pen-red"><strong>dev</strong></mark>. But don't worry, we're ensuring a seamless transition, just as we did with Runeforge.io. Both the old and new URLs will continue to direct you to the same comprehensive wiki for a <strong>limited time</strong> during this migration period, ensuring uninterrupted access to all your modding resources. This move allows us to offer a more robust and flexible environment to support the League of Legends modding community.</span></p>
