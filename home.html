<p>As you know, maintaining a valuable resource like this modding Wiki requires ongoing support. To help us keep the Wiki running smoothly, we've recently introduced some unobtrusive video ads. These appear only when a sponsor claims a spot, so you won't experience disruptive pop-ups or flashy banners.</p>
<p>We understand some users prefer ad blockers. However, if you're comfortable disabling them for this site, it would be a big help.  These ads provide a way to ensure the Wiki remains a reliable source for all your League of Legends modding needs.</p>
<p>Rest assured, we have strict guidelines in place. You'll never see any harmful or irrelevant ads displayed here.</p>
