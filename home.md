# Latest News

## Runeforge 2.0

As of now, the provider for Runeforge is getting a little out of our hands, which is why we upgrade our site (in time). Take a look at the official Statement on [X *(Twitter)*](https://x.com/RuneForgeio/status/1835693736396742896):

> **We Are Experiencing Unprecedented Growth**
> 
> RuneForge has been experiencing unprecedented growth—our traffic has surged 4-5x beyond what our current platform can handle. In short: we're suffering from success. We’re thrilled by this overwhelming support from the community. This is a problem we never dreamed to have when we launched last year.
> 
> However, our current website provider, Wix, was designed for small personal blogs, shops and landing pages. This has limited our ability to build new features and upkeep our current site-functionality. We recognize that this impacts your experience, and we're committed to making it better. In the past few months, we’ve been hard at work on RuneForge 2.0, a new custom-made platform that will allow us to provide the features and functionality that we've been planning and that you've been asking for. Our goal is to create a site that not only meets, but also exceeds, your expectations.
> 
> **But Our Future Takes Time... and Money**
> 
> Building our new platform requires significant time and resources. If you'd like to support our journey and get a behind-the-scenes look at our development progress, consider subscribing through our Discord Server's Shop. Your support will allow us to accelerate our work and will help shape the future of RuneForge and League modding as a whole.
> 
> Thank you for being part of this incredible journey so far! We couldn't have done it without every single one of you.

## Ads

As you know, maintaining a valuable resource like this modding Wiki requires ongoing support. To help us keep the Wiki running smoothly, we've recently introduced some unobtrusive video ads. These appear only when a sponsor claims a spot, so you won't experience disruptive pop-ups or flashy banners.

We understand some users prefer ad blockers. However, if you're comfortable disabling them for this site, it would be a big help.  These ads provide a way to ensure the Wiki remains a reliable source for all your League of Legends modding needs.

Rest assured, we have strict guidelines in place. You'll never see any harmful or irrelevant ads displayed here.
