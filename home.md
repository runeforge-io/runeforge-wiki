# **Welcome to the Runeforge Wiki!**

We are a community dedicated in creating Mods for League of Legends. If you see help, you shall find it in here, with out evergrowing list of guides and informations all about modding League of Legends. 

If you are new to our community, we highly recommend starting [here](/core-guides/get-started), where you find a List with nessecities and starter guides to get a leap into your new journey!

# How to use the Wiki?

The guides are sorted by what you try to achieve. If you want to texture something you click on "Texturing" at the sidebar. Simple right?

However, alot of guides collide with each thematic, so even if you just want to texture something, it may happen that you also need to edit a bin file (which would be coding). An example for this would be on how to add "Special Materials". In that case, we order guides by what your goal is. In our example it would be by adding a texture, so the guide would still be in "Texturing".

If you don't find what you need in our list, you can also use the search function by directly searching what you need or by searching by tags! Tag-searching is the icon next to the search bar. From there, you can select tags which would describe your goal the best.

If you still can't find what you need then either, the guide/ page doesn't exist yet or you can ask for help at ourÂ [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/runeforge). We always try to get more users to skin creating and influence us with their creative minds.

# Latest News

## Ads

As you know, maintaining a valuable resource like this modding Wiki requires ongoing support. To help us keep the Wiki running smoothly, we've recently introduced some unobtrusive video ads. These appear only when a sponsor claims a spot, so you won't experience disruptive pop-ups or flashy banners.

We understand some users prefer ad blockers. However, if you're comfortable disabling them for this site, it would be a big help.  These ads provide a way to ensure the Wiki remains a reliable source for all your League of Legends modding needs.

Rest assured, we have strict guidelines in place. You'll never see any harmful or irrelevant ads displayed here.

## Vanguard Launched!

Since Patch _**14.9**_, League of Legends added their anti cheat software **Vanguard**, which some might know already through Valorant. In order for you to safely continue to use custom skins, we need you to use the **newest** version of [cs-lol manager](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager/releases). 
If you want more information about concerns regarding cs-lol manager and Vanguard, please check out our [**FAQ**](/faq#what-about-vanguard)
