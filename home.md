# Welcome to the Runeforge Wiki

This wiki is for custom skins (also known as custom content) and provides a source of information across the League of Legends modding community.

# Vanguard Launched!

Since Patch _**14.9**_, League of Legends added their anti cheat software **Vanguard**, which some might know already through Valorant. In order for you to safely continue to use custom skins, we need you to use the **newest** version of [cs-lol manager](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager/releases). 
If you want more information about concerns regarding cs-lol manager and Vanguard, please check out our [**FAQ**](/faq#what-about-vanguard)

# How to use the Wiki?

The guides are sorted by what you try to achieve. If you want to texture something you click on "Texturing" at the sidebar. Simple right?

However, alot of guides collide with each thematic, so even if you just want to texture something, it may happen that you also need to edit a bin file (which would be coding). An example for this would be on how to add "Special Materials". In that case, we order guides by what your goal is. In our example it would be by adding a texture, so the guide would still be in "Texturing".

If you don't find what you need in our list, you can also use the search function by directly searching what you need or by searching by tags! Tag-searching is the icon next to the search bar. From there, you can select tags which would describe your goal the best.

If you still can't find what you need then either, the guide/ page doesn't exist yet or you can ask for help at ourÂ [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/runeforge). We always try to get more users to skin creating and influence us with their creative minds.
