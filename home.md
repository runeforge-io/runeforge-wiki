> Even tho, you can contribute to this wiki at the moment, it is not recommended right now. Since we are still deciding if we keep this version or code a new one. For now, you can add pages and/or just make an account. If not, thats fine aswell. As soon as we decide on what we do, we will notify you here and at the official [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/runeforge-1062123296725930074)!
